# GPU-accelerated-image-processing
This repository contains a collection of OpenCL kernels for image processing. It comes with tens of operations for filtering, binarizing, labeling, measuring in images, projections, transformations and mathematical operations for images. While most of these are classical image processing operations, also allows performing operations on matrices potentially representing neighborhood relationships between cells and pixels.Increased efforts were put on documentation, code examples, user-convenience and interoperability to be more helpful if you want to learn OpenCL.
